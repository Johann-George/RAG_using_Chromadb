Based on that theme our Student chapter had also submitted a proposal called the IET Outreach 150 Its an initiative to reachout to the community to extend our skills as well as to learn how the engineering fraternity can make an impact or change for a better and sustainable living among those in need

The IET MBCET On Campus proposal on Outreach 150 is one among the 4 that got selected from India

We are proud to collaborate with Vydyuthi Energy Services VES led by its Founder and our Alumnus Mr Anoop Babu EEE 200307 for this venture as our mutual vision is to work towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals

On February 9 Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology in Nalanchira saw its gates open to its first ever TEDx event TEDxMBCET an independently organized TED event featuring 7 speakers from various walks of life The theme for the day was Observably Random a look into the fascinating world of chaos randomness and the ever growing world of the trivial

The inauguration of the event started at 10 30 am with the ceremonial lamp being lit by Rev Fr Raju Parukoor Asst Bursar Dr T M George Principal DrTessy Mathew Head of Department and Devi VS student coordinator and event licensee The first talk of the day was by Arjun Hari CEO of WudiDatatech Pvt Ltd He shared some wise words with the attendees on the topic of career disillusionment and why its okay to not have a fixed career path in this modern age Following up on Arjun was the musician Akhil Vinay whose life story resembles that of the great pianist Ray Charles Blinded at age of 9 Akhil Vinay passionately followed his love of music and still practices and teaches music today Akhils talk was centred around his life and his experiences as he started going blind

Next up on the roster was the ever fantastic Nikhil Prasad founder and creative head of Karriku Fresh Keralas first exclusively digital media platform He talked about his struggles starting the enterprise and inspired attendees to dream big dreams and never let them die The fourth speaker of the day was the ever energetic Nilja K Baby Radio Jockey at Radio Mirchi Kochi A person who uses her voice everyday to provide for herself it was no surprise that her talk also revolved around that She delineates an experience from her life when she was forced to raise her voice for herself She encouraged everyone in the audience to never lose your voice and to always stand your ground

The next speaker was the programmer and freethinker Alok Rajasukumaran Aloks talk was without a doubt the most unique of the day as he took the audience through a philosophical adventure through the cosmos the universe and existentialism After a short break we resumed with the exuberant Ambika Bhardwaj Traveller and Writer Better known to her fans as Dastaan e Musafir she detailed her experiences travelling from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and taught the audience how they can also do the same for almost free Closing off the talks for the days was the amazing Job Kurian playback singer and music composer Job talked about his life and experiences in the music industry and the changes brought on by following his passion

Unlike most other TEDx events TEDxMBCET also had a star studded cast of talented performers The first performance of the day was by a group of students from MBCET Sraavan Krishnakumar and Achuyth Ramesh violinists joined by Ryan Issac pianist performed instrumental renditions of various pop songs as the audience sat thrilled and mesmerised The next performer was the indie alternative rock band Adholokam They performed covers of popular malayalam songs and even some of their originals like Pakshi

Job Kurian again makes an appearance on stage but this time with a persona he has donned many times before He performed many songs from his repertoire and each song ended with his audience asking for more

TEDxMBCET started out as a small idea that grew into a possibility that flourished itself into a reality A reality that was successful inspiring entertaining and motivating

Many institutes of excellence have developed many multifaceted enigmas Theatre has been always considered as an elite device used to bring forth the attention to burning issues through humour satire monologues and other similar subtle theatrical expressions

nstitutes of global repute have often formed unofficial theatre groups The most famous amongst them being The Monty Python and the Flying Circus associated with Oxford university MBCET is also in our own league in developing well formed individuals and has thus started a theatre club which acts as earth to bring out the creative energies of its students Though small in size we hope to entertain and tickle the grey matter through few activities like a contemporary skit planned in the near future

We are on the cusp of the Fourth Industrial Revolution or Industry 40 If Industry 40 is defined by connected cyberphysical systems powered by IoT Industry 50 would be emphasizing on increased collaboration between humans and smart systems machines take over all monotonous repetitive tasks while humans engage the creative side More and more corporate establishments including the prominent ones are actively shifting focus towards new ways of measuring employability as a consequence of the changing nature of work

The Corporate Relations at MBCET aims to create an ecosystem for the promotion of skill development establishment of industryacademia connect and foster innovation and entrepreneurship Industryacademia connect enables academic interventions for technological innovations or modifications especially in small and medium scale industries Entrepreneurship nurturing needs an ecosystem  seed soil climate and culture elements  to craft the mindset and competency to develop entrepreneurs of the future who use creative approaches to solve existing or future problems faster cheaper and better with the help of new tools and technologies

Most debates around the future of education focus on the skills needed for the future We have to slowly move towards the reality with more focus on acquiring employability skills along with the degree for our graduates to compete and sustain in the digitized and fluid job markets in the future

Aardram Fanning the Flames of Compassion and Patriotism in the Heart of Kerala

 httpsmbcetacinwpcontentuploads202306IMG20230622WA0001168x300jpg   From the shores of Vettucaud beach to the mechanical engineering department of Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology MBCET a wave of change has been sparked riding on the wings of compassion and unity The S3 mechanical students of MBCET have risen not just as engineers of the future but as responsible citizens of today under the banner of Aardram

   Their journey started on the beaches of Kerala home to a heartwrenching paradox  breathtaking natural beauty marred by the carelessness of its own people The beaches overrun with plastic and waste bore the brunt of increasing tourism and the apathy of those who were supposed to be their caretakers But Aardram stepped in turning this tragedy into an opportunity for change

    On February 26th as the sun painted the sky in hues of orange and purple 35 students embarked on a mission to reclaim the beauty of Vettucaud beach Armed with gloves and determination they collected separated and responsibly disposed of the waste leaving behind a cleaner safer beach They even creatively repurposed the recyclable plastic into a green facade and bottle stand showcasing the potential of waste when viewed through the lens of sustainability

     The clubs journey did not stop there On 29th July 2022 Aardram was officially recognized as a charity club of MBCET with its logo launched amidst music dance and heartfelt speeches Their mission To extend a hand of solace to those in distress to be a beacon of hope for the needy and to instill a spirit of service among their peers

    Then came the celebration of Indias Independence Day A day filled with pride patriotism and unity where the tricolor flag was hoisted stirring speeches were delivered and the melodies of the music club echoed through the campus Each department participated with fervor culminating in a grand procession and an award ceremony for the best performers

   Aardrams journey is more than a series of events It is an inspiring tale of change of students stepping up to shoulder responsibilities that extend beyond textbooks and classrooms Their efforts are a testament to the power of compassion and unity showing us that we are not powerless against the challenges our society faces

   From cleaning beaches to launching a charity club the students of Aardram have shown that change begins with a single step It begins with acknowledging our role as stewards of the planet and caretakers of our fellow beings Today they are not just students  they are changemakers leading by example and inspiring others to follow

    Let their journey inspire each of us to look beyond ourselves to recognize the power we hold and to use it for the betterment of our society After all every wave of change begins with a single ripple Lets be that ripple Lets be Aardram

On February 9 Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology in Nalanchira saw its gates open to its first ever TEDx event TEDxMBCET an independently organized TED event featuring 7 speakers from various walks of life The theme for the day was Observably Random a look into the fascinating world of chaos randomness and the ever growing world of the trivial

The inauguration of the event started at 10 30 am with the ceremonial lamp being lit by Rev Fr Raju Parukoor Asst Bursar Dr T M George Principal DrTessy Mathew Head of Department and Devi VS student coordinator and event licensee The first talk of the day was by Arjun Hari CEO of WudiDatatech Pvt Ltd He shared some wise words with the attendees on the topic of career disillusionment and why its okay to not have a fixed career path in this modern age Following up on Arjun was the musician Akhil Vinay whose life story resembles that of the great pianist Ray Charles Blinded at age of 9 Akhil Vinay passionately followed his love of music and still practices and teaches music today Akhils talk was centred around his life and his experiences as he started going blind

Next up on the roster was the ever fantastic Nikhil Prasad founder and creative head of Karriku Fresh Keralas first exclusively digital media platform He talked about his struggles starting the enterprise and inspired attendees to dream big dreams and never let them die The fourth speaker of the day was the ever energetic Nilja K Baby Radio Jockey at Radio Mirchi Kochi A person who uses her voice everyday to provide for herself it was no surprise that her talk also revolved around that She delineates an experience from her life when she was forced to raise her voice for herself She encouraged everyone in the audience to never lose your voice and to always stand your ground

The next speaker was the programmer and freethinker Alok Rajasukumaran Aloks talk was without a doubt the most unique of the day as he took the audience through a philosophical adventure through the cosmos the universe and existentialism After a short break we resumed with the exuberant Ambika Bhardwaj Traveller and Writer Better known to her fans as Dastaan e Musafir she detailed her experiences travelling from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and taught the audience how they can also do the same for almost free Closing off the talks for the days was the amazing Job Kurian playback singer and music composer Job talked about his life and experiences in the music industry and the changes brought on by following his passion

Unlike most other TEDx events TEDxMBCET also had a star studded cast of talented performers The first performance of the day was by a group of students from MBCET Sraavan Krishnakumar and Achuyth Ramesh violinists joined by Ryan Issac pianist performed instrumental renditions of various pop songs as the audience sat thrilled and mesmerised The next performer was the indie alternative rock band Adholokam They performed covers of popular malayalam songs and even some of their originals like Pakshi

Job Kurian again makes an appearance on stage but this time with a persona he has donned many times before He performed many songs from his repertoire and each song ended with his audience asking for more

TEDxMBCET started out as a small idea that grew into a possibility that flourished itself into a reality A reality that was successful inspiring entertaining and motivating
